## 🚀 Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK (3.0 or higher)
- Android Studio / Xcode
- Firebase CLI
- Python 3.8+ (for ML model training)

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fraudguard.git
   cd fraudguard
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Configure Firebase**
   ```bash
   firebase login
   firebase init
   ```

4. **Setup ML Models**
   ```bash
   # Download pre-trained models
   flutter pub run ml_model_downloader
   ```

5. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

### 🔧 Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
ML_MODEL_PATH=assets/models/fraud_detection.tflite
OCR_LANGUAGE=en
```

## 📖 Usage

### Basic Workflow

1. **Document Upload**: Capture or upload insurance claim documents
2. **OCR Processing**: Automatic text extraction and data parsing
3. **Fraud Analysis**: ML model processes extracted data for fraud indicators
4. **Risk Assessment**: Generate comprehensive risk score and recommendations
5. **Report Generation**: Export detailed analysis reports

### Code Example

```dart
// Initialize Fraud Detection Engine
final fraudDetector = FraudDetector();

// Process Document
final result = await fraudDetector.analyzeDocument(
  imagePath: 'path/to/claim_document.jpg',
  claimData: claimFormData,
);

// Get Risk Assessment
final riskScore = result.riskScore;
final confidence = result.confidence;
final recommendations = result.recommendations;
```
